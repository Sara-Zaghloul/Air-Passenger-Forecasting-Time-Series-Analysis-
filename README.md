### Dataset Attributes
    
- Month: Month and Year values
- Passengers : Number of passengers travelling using aeroplanes.


### Summury :
- Statistical Tests for Time Series Analysis.
- Order selection for ARIMA & SARIMA models.
- In-sample and Out-of-sample forecasting using rolling & non-rolling methods.
- Difference between forecast function and predict function of ARIMA & SARIMA.



### Components of Time Series :
- A Time Series consists of the following components :

    - **Trend** : Long term direction of the data.
    
    E.g : Year on year rising temperature of the Earth due to Global Warming.
